# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
1. Mutation #1 (on line #123, mutation #5)<br>
Mutation applied by Pitest tool - Replaced double subtraction with addition on method Range.getLength(). This mutant was applied on the following line:
> return this.upper - this.lower;
This mutation replaced the "-" with 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

  Since only 5 methods out of the 15 total methods in the Range class were tested, the Mutation Score mentioned above is not accurate. The following table shows the mutation score for each of the 5 tested methods and the total mutation score from these 5 tested methods in Range Class.
  |Tested Method| # of Survived Mutants| # of Killed Mutants | Total | Mutation Score |
  |-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|----------------|
  |Range.combine(Range range1, Range range2)| 6 | 27 | 33 | 82 %|
  |Range.toString()| 4 | 18 | 22 | 82% |
  |Range.getLength()| 4 | 15 | 19 | 79% |
  |Range.getLowerBound()| 1 | 6 | 7 | 86% |
  |Range.getUpperBound()| 1 | 6 | 7 | 86% |
  |Total| 16 | 72 | 88 | 82% |
